# PHP-Ajax-Crud
 This repository contains a simple demonstration of how to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using PHP and Ajax. CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, allowing users to interact with data by creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from a database.

 ## Features

* ##### Create: Add new records to the database using a user-friendly interface.
* ##### Read: Display existing records in a tabular format for easy viewing and navigation.
* ##### Update: Modify and update existing records directly from the interface.
* ##### Delete: Remove unwanted records with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.

## Technologies Used

* ##### PHP: Backend scripting language for server-side logic and database interactions.
* ##### Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML for seamless, dynamic updates without page reloads.
* ##### MySQL: Database management system for storing and managing data.
* ##### HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Getting Started
To get started with this PHP Ajax CRUD demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a local server environment with PHP and MySQL support.
3. Import the included SQL file to create the necessary database and table structure.
4. Update the database connection settings in the PHP files (config.php, functions.php) with your credentials.
5. Access the application through your web browser to start testing CRUD operations.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your project requirements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
