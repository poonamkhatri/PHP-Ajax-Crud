# PHP-Ajax-Crud
 This repository contains a simple demonstration of how to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using PHP and Ajax. CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, allowing users to interact with data by creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from a database.

 ## Features

* ##### Create: Add new records to the database using a user-friendly interface.
* ##### Read: Display existing records in a tabular format for easy viewing and navigation.
* ##### Update: Modify and update existing records directly from the interface.
* ##### Delete: Remove unwanted records with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.
